                <p>
                    This family picture isn’t just a snapshot; it’s a time capsule of love, laughter, and unspoken bonds. It reminds me where I come from and the people who shaped my heart. A moment frozen in time, yet forever alive in my soul.

                <h2>BABY ME</h2>
                <p>
                    This is me, Reyalyn Tulio Ayok, at just 6 months old. I chose to share this photo because it’s my favorite among all the pictures I’ve ever taken, even more than my recent ones. This image holds a special place in my heart because it captures a moment from when I was just beginning to explore and become aware of the world around me.

                <h2>THE PRESENT ME</h2>
                <p>
                    The present me is a testament to growth, resilience, and self-love. Every scar, smile, and lesson brought me here. I cherish this version of myself because it’s proof that I’m not just surviving—I’m thriving.
